"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances.

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.
"
✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?

The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances.

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.
"
✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?

The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances.

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.
"
✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?

The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances.

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.
"
✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?

The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances.

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.
"
✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?

The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."

After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances.

The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."

This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.
"
✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?

The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."

I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while). For almost double the price of Economy, I don't think it makes sense to fly World Traveller Plus on this route."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

✅ Verified Review |  British Airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering. I recently flew with BA from Gatwick to Marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of EasyJet. The catering with the new M&S food can be described as nothing short of chaotic. On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets. Is one toilet for 200 people realistic BA?
"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent. British Airways have lost the plot - fly with someone else."
"❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
